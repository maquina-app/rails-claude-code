## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install the Skill

**Upload to Claude Project:**

1. Open your Claude Project
2. Go to Project Settings → Knowledge
3. Upload the entire `rails-upgrade-assistant/` folder
4. Or upload just `SKILL.md` for minimal setup

### Step 2: Verify MCP Connection

**Required: Rails MCP Server**

A Ruby implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Rails projects. This server allows LLMs (Large Language Models) to interact with Rails projects through the Model Context Protocol, providing capabilities for code analysis, exploration, and development assistance.

[Install instructions](https://github.com/maquina-app/rails-mcp-server)


**Optional: Neovim MCP Server** (for interactive file updates)

A Ruby implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Neovim. This server allows LLMs (Large Language Models) to interact with Neovim through the Model Context Protocol, providing capabilities to query buffers and perform operations within the editor.

[Install instructions](https://github.com/maquina-app/nvim-mcp-server)

### Step 3: Start Upgrading!

```
Say to Claude:
"Upgrade my Rails app to 8.1"
```

Claude will:
1. Detect your current Rails version
2. Plan the upgrade path (single or multi-hop)
3. Analyze your project for custom code
4. Generate comprehensive upgrade report
5. Provide step-by-step instructions
6. Optionally update files interactively

---

## 📊 Supported Upgrade Paths

| From | To | Hops | Breaking Changes | Difficulty | Key Changes |
|------|----|----|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| 8.0.x | 8.1.1 | 1 | 8 changes | ⭐ Easy | SSL config, bundler-audit |
| 7.2.x | 8.0.4 | 1 | 13 changes | ⭐⭐⭐ Hard | Propshaft, Solid gems |
| 7.1.x | 7.2.3 | 1 | 38 changes | ⭐⭐ Medium | Transaction jobs, PWA |
| 7.0.x | 7.1.6 | 1 | 12 changes | ⭐⭐ Medium | cache_classes, SSL |
| 6.1.x | 7.0.0 | 1 | 17 changes | ⭐⭐⭐ Hard | Webpacker, framework defaults |
| 6.0.x | 6.1.0 | 1 | 18 changes | ⭐⭐ Medium | Active Storage, per-db connections |
| 6.0.x | 8.1.1 | 6 | All 106 changes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Hard | Multi-hop required |

### 🚨 Important: No Version Skipping!

Rails upgrades MUST be sequential:

```
✅ Correct: 6.0 → 6.1 → 7.0 → 7.1 → 7.2 → 8.0 → 8.1
❌ Wrong:   6.0 → 7.0 (skips 6.1)
❌ Wrong:   7.0 → 8.0 (skips 7.1, 7.2)
```

If you request a multi-hop upgrade (e.g., 6.0 → 8.1), Claude will:
- Explain the sequential requirement
- Plan all intermediate hops
- Generate separate reports for each hop
- Guide you through completing each hop before moving to next

---

## 💬 How to Use

### Mode 1: Report-Only (Recommended for First Time)

**Best for:** Understanding what needs to change before making any edits

**Usage:**

```
"Upgrade my Rails app from 7.2 to 8.0"
```

**Claude will:**

1. Call `railsMcpServer:project_info` to detect current version
2. Load appropriate version guide(s)
3. Analyze your project files for custom code
4. Identify breaking changes affecting YOUR code
5. Generate comprehensive upgrade report with:
   - Executive summary
   - Breaking changes (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority)
   - OLD vs NEW code examples
   - ⚠️ Custom code warnings
   - Step-by-step migration guide
   - Testing checklist
   - Rollback plan

**You remain in control:** Review the report and apply changes manually.

---

### Mode 2: Interactive with Neovim (Advanced)

**Best for:** Experienced users who want live file updates

**Requirements:**

- Files open in Neovim
- Neovim socket at `/tmp/nvim-{project_name}.sock`
- Neovim MCP server connected

**Usage:**

```
"Upgrade to Rails 8.1 in interactive mode with project 'myapp'"
```

**Claude will:**

1. Generate full upgrade report (like Mode 1)
2. Check which files are open in Neovim via `nvimMcpServer:get_project_buffers`
3. For each file needing changes:
   - Show current code (OLD)
   - Show proposed code (NEW)
   - Ask: "Should I update this file?"
   - If yes: Use `nvimMcpServer:update_buffer` to update
   - If no: Skip and note you can apply manually
4. Verify each change applied successfully
5. Summarize all changes made

**Safety features:**
- ✅ Shows changes BEFORE applying
- ✅ Requires approval for each file
- ✅ Checks buffer availability
- ✅ Never modifies files you haven't opened
- ✅ Preserves custom configurations

---

### Mode 3: Query-Specific (Quick Answers)

**Best for:** Specific questions about changes

**Examples:**

```
"What ActiveRecord changes are in Rails 8.0?"
→ Shows only ActiveRecord-related changes

"How do I handle the SSL configuration change?"
→ Shows detailed SSL migration steps

"What breaking changes affect my models?"
→ Analyzes your models and shows relevant changes

"Show me all configuration file changes for 7.2"
→ Filters for config updates in Rails 7.2

"Will my Redis cache work after upgrading to 8.0?"
→ Checks Solid Cache changes and provides guidance
```

---

## 🚨 Custom Code Detection & Preservation

The skill automatically detects and warns about customizations:

### Database Configuration

```ruby
⚠️ Custom SQLite path detected in config/database.yml
   Current: database: db/development.sqlite3
   Rails 7.1+: database: storage/development.sqlite3
   Action: Review and update path
```

### SSL Middleware

```ruby
⚠️ Custom SSL middleware detected in config/application.rb
   Line 23: middleware.use CustomSSLMiddleware
   Rails 7.1+: May conflict with config.force_ssl = true
   Action: Review compatibility and remove if redundant
```

### Autoload Paths

```ruby
⚠️ Custom autoload_paths in config/application.rb
   Line 15: config.autoload_paths << Rails.root.join('lib')
   Rails 7.1+: lib/ autoloaded by default (config.autoload_lib)
   Action: Remove manual path, may cause naming conflicts
```

### Cache Configuration

```ruby
⚠️ Explicit cache format version in config/application.rb
   Line 28: config.cache_format_version = 7.0
   Rails 7.1+: Can upgrade to 7.1 after full deployment
   Action: Consider upgrading format for performance
```

### Asset Pipeline

```ruby
⚠️ Custom Sprockets processors detected
   Files: lib/assets/processors/custom_minifier.rb
   Rails 8.0+: Propshaft doesn't support processors
   Action: Migrate to different approach or keep Sprockets
```

### Redis Configuration

```ruby
⚠️ Manual Redis configuration in config/initializers/
   File: config/initializers/redis.rb
   Rails 8.0+: Solid Cache may replace manual Redis setup
   Action: Consider migrating to Solid Cache or keep custom
```

**Every breaking change includes ⚠️ warnings for common customizations!**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Always Read the Full Report First

Don't start making changes until you understand the complete scope. The report is designed to be read from start to finish.

### 2. Test Incrementally

Apply one change → test → commit → repeat. Don't make all changes at once.

```bash
# Good workflow
git checkout -b rails-upgrade
# Apply change 1
bin/rails test
git commit -am "Change 1: Update Gemfile"
# Apply change 2
bin/rails test
git commit -am "Change 2: Update config"
```

### 3. Use Staging Extensively

Especially for major version jumps (7.2 → 8.0), test thoroughly in staging before production.

### 4. Monitor Carefully Post-Deploy

Watch error rates, performance metrics, and user feedback closely for 24-48 hours after production deployment.

### 5. Keep Rollback Ready

Your rollback should be tested and executable in < 5 minutes. Practice it in staging first.

### 6. Multi-Hop: Complete Each Hop Fully

For multi-version upgrades, complete each hop entirely (including production deploy and monitoring) before starting the next hop.

### 7. Document As You Go

Keep notes on what worked, what didn't, and any custom workarounds. This helps future upgrades.

### 8. Focus on HIGH Priority First

Address all HIGH priority breaking changes before touching MEDIUM or LOW priority items.

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Rails MCP server not connected"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify installation
npm list -g rails-mcp-server

# Reinstall if needed
npm install -g rails-mcp-server

# Check Claude configuration
cat ~/.config/Claude/config.json
# Verify "rails" is in mcpServers
```

### "Can't detect my Rails version"

**Solution:**

1. Ensure you're in Rails project root
2. Verify Gemfile exists
3. Check `gem 'rails'` line in Gemfile
4. Manually tell Claude: "My Rails version is X.Y.Z"

### "Interactive mode not working"

**Solution:**

1. Neovim must be running
2. Check socket exists: `ls /tmp/nvim-*.sock`
3. Verify project name matches socket name
4. Try report-only mode first
5. Check Neovim MCP server installation

### "Too many custom code warnings"

**Solution:**

This is normal! The skill is being thorough. Focus on:
1. HIGH priority warnings first
2. Warnings in files you actually use
3. Ignore warnings for files you plan to remove

### "Tests failing after upgrade"

**Solution:**

1. Ask Claude: "My tests are failing with [error message]"
2. Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for your error
3. Review the breaking changes section for your upgrade
4. Verify you applied all required changes

### "Assets not loading after 7.2 → 8.0"

**Solution:**

This is the Sprockets → Propshaft migration. See:
1. `version-guides/upgrade-7.2-to-8.0.md` → Asset Pipeline section
2. Check `app/assets/config/manifest.js` exists
3. Verify asset paths in views
4. Review `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` → Assets section
