## 🆕 What's New: Modular Architecture

### New Design (Modular)
- ✅ Compact SKILL.md (300 lines)
- ✅ Selective loading based on request
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Easy to maintain and extend

### How Claude Uses the Modular Structure

**Simple request:** "Upgrade my Rails app to 8.1"
```
1. Read: SKILL.md (300 lines) → Get overview
2. Load: workflows/upgrade-report-workflow.md → How to generate report
3. Load: workflows/detection-script-workflow.md → How to generate script
4. Load: workflows/app-update-preview-workflow.md → How to generate preview
5. Reference: reference/quality-checklist → Verify output
6. Generate: All 3 deliverables
```
**Total read:** ~1,500 lines (only what's needed)

**Detection script only:** "Create detection script for Rails 8.0"
```
1. Read: SKILL.md (300 lines) → Get overview
2. Load: workflows/detection-script-workflow.md → How to generate script
3. Reference: examples/detection-script-only.md → Example structure
4. Generate: Just detection script
```
**Total read:** ~950 lines (skips irrelevant workflows)

**Multi-hop upgrade:** "Upgrade from Rails 7.0 to 8.1"
```
1. Read: SKILL.md (300 lines) → Get overview  
2. Load: examples/multi-hop-upgrade.md → Understand approach
3. Confirm: Which approach user wants
4. Load workflows: As needed for each hop
```
**Total read:** ~600 lines initially, then workflows on demand

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install the Skill (2 minutes)

**Upload to Claude Project:**
1. Open your Claude Project
2. Go to Project Settings → Knowledge
3. Upload the entire `rails-upgrade-assistant/` folder
4. Verify all directories are uploaded (SKILL.md, workflows/, examples/, etc.)

### Step 2: Verify MCP Connection (1 minute)

**Required:** [Rails MCP Server](https://github.com/maquina-app/rails-mcp-server)
- Provides project analysis capabilities
- Reads your code and configuration
- Detects custom implementations

**Optional:** [Neovim MCP Server](https://github.com/maquina-app/nvim-mcp-server)
- Enables interactive file updates  
- Live buffer management
- Real-time code changes

### Step 3: Start Upgrading! (2 minutes)

```
Say to Claude:
"Upgrade my Rails app to 8.1"
```

Claude will:
1. Load SKILL.md to understand the request
2. Load relevant workflow files for deliverable generation
3. Detect your current Rails version
4. Plan the upgrade path
5. Analyze your project for custom code
6. Generate comprehensive report with all 3 deliverables

## 📊 Supported Upgrade Paths

| From | To | Hops | Breaking Changes | Difficulty | Key Changes |
|------|----|----|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| 8.0.x | 8.1.1 | 1 | 8 changes | ⭐ Easy | SSL config, bundler-audit |
| 7.2.x | 8.0.4 | 1 | 13 changes | ⭐⭐⭐ Hard | Propshaft, Solid gems |
| 7.1.x | 7.2.3 | 1 | 38 changes | ⭐⭐ Medium | Transaction jobs, PWA |
| 7.0.x | 7.1.6 | 1 | 12 changes | ⭐⭐ Medium | cache_classes, SSL |
| 6.1.x | 7.0.0 | 1 | 17 changes | ⭐⭐⭐ Hard | Webpacker, framework defaults |
| 6.0.x | 6.1.0 | 1 | 18 changes | ⭐⭐ Medium | Active Storage, per-db connections |
| 6.0.x | 8.1.1 | 6 | All 106 changes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Hard | Multi-hop required |

### 🚨 Important: No Version Skipping!

Rails upgrades MUST be sequential:
```
✅ Correct: 6.0 → 6.1 → 7.0 → 7.1 → 7.2 → 8.0 → 8.1
❌ Wrong:   6.0 → 7.0 (skips 6.1)
❌ Wrong:   7.0 → 8.0 (skips 7.1, 7.2)
```

The skill automatically handles this by:
- Explaining sequential requirements
- Loading `examples/multi-hop-upgrade.md` for guidance
- Planning all intermediate hops
- Loading workflows on-demand for each hop

## 🎯 What You'll Get

### Three Deliverables for Every Upgrade

The modular skill generates three comprehensive deliverables by loading specific workflow files:

#### 1. **Upgrade Report** (50+ pages)
*Workflow: `workflows/upgrade-report-workflow.md`*

- Executive summary
- Project analysis
- Breaking changes (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority)
- New features & deprecations
- OLD vs NEW code examples
- ⚠️ Custom code warnings
- Step-by-step migration guide
- Testing checklist
- Rollback plan
- Official resources

#### 2. **Detection Script** (Bash)
*Workflow: `workflows/detection-script-workflow.md`*

- Automated code scanning
- Pattern-based detection
- Custom configuration checks
- Compatibility verification
- Instant feedback on readiness
- Pre-upgrade validation

#### 3. **App:Update Preview** (Config Changes)
*Workflow: `workflows/app-update-preview-workflow.md`*

- Before/after config comparison
- File-by-file changes
- Custom code preservation
- Neovim integration (optional)
- Interactive updates

### Code Examples Format

Every change includes OLD vs NEW comparison:
```ruby
# OLD (Rails 8.0)
config.force_ssl = true

# NEW (Rails 8.1)
config.assume_ssl = true
config.force_ssl = true

# WHY: New assume_ssl handles proxy scenarios
# IMPACT: ⚠️ Review if using custom SSL middleware
```

### Custom Code Detection

Automatic warnings for your customizations:
```
⚠️ Custom SSL middleware detected in config/application.rb
⚠️ Manual Redis configuration found in initializers
⚠️ Custom asset pipeline processors in lib/
```

---

## 🔒 Safety Features

The modular skill is designed with safety as the top priority:

- ✅ **Never modifies files without permission**
- ✅ **Always generates report first for review**
- ✅ **Detects custom code automatically**
- ✅ **Marks all customizations with ⚠️ warnings**
- ✅ **Based on official Rails CHANGELOGs**
- ✅ **Provides rollback plans**
- ✅ **Includes comprehensive testing checklists**
- ✅ **Loads only relevant workflows** (efficient and focused)

You remain in complete control at all times.

---

## 🎨 Two Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Report-Only (Default)
- Generates comprehensive report with all 3 deliverables
- You review and apply changes manually
- Best for: Complex upgrades, team review, learning
- Workflow files loaded: All 3 (upgrade-report, detection-script, app-update-preview)

### Mode 2: Interactive (Advanced)
- Requires Neovim integration
- Updates files in real-time
- Best for: Experienced users, simple upgrades
- Workflow files loaded: All 3 + Neovim buffer management

Both modes fully documented in USAGE-GUIDE.md.

---

## 🆘 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Issue | Quick Fix | Details |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Skill not responding | Verify installation: "List skills" | README.md |
| Can't detect version | Check Gemfile exists | USAGE-GUIDE.md |
| MCP server error | Reinstall: `npm install -g rails-mcp-server` | USAGE-GUIDE.md |
| Report too generic | Ask: "Analyze my config first" | USAGE-GUIDE.md |
| Tests failing | Review custom code warnings | USAGE-GUIDE.md |
| Workflow not found | Verify directory structure complete | Implementation Guide |

Full troubleshooting in USAGE-GUIDE.md and `reference/reference-files-package.md`.
